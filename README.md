## Abstract <a name="Abstract"></a>
In the 17th century, Molière, the French playwright, actor, and poet depicted the customs and morals of his day. The analysis of his work allows us today to have an idea of the societal issues and the questionings of that time. Artistic expression and, more precisely, the 7th art can provide a lot of information about society’s thoughts. 
The goal in this project is to analyze the content of plot summaries and characterized them by looking at the world fields, word occurrences, as well as the words polarity and general sentences. This would allow to identify the main concerns of society (e.g., climate catastrophe, war, technological disaster, family disunity) and evaluate the feelings associated with these topics. We also want to see the evolution of these concerns over time and include critical reviews of the movies to obtain a more complete characterization of the situation.
